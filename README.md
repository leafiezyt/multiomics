# multiomics
This is a pet project I run under the context of multiomics data integration.
I hope to utilize multi-layers of data to find patient subgroups (novel or not) and associate them with phenotypic characteristics we care about. Along this process, we may find out disease mechnisms and help patient diagonosis and accelerate drug discovery pipeline.
